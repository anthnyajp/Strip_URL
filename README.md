# Strip_URL
Includes 3 PowersShell scripts to strip URL by host, path, port, scheme, etc. 

- URL_Strip_JustHost.ps1 - Uses txt file as input and strips to just show the hostname of the URL in the screen output 
- URL_Strip_SingleURL.ps1 - Processes single URL (URL in script) and strips the URL by host, path, port, scheme, etc. and outputs on screen
- URL_StripBulk - Uses txt file as input and exports URL segments into CSV file.



Save WebURLs.txt file to 'c:\downloads\' and update with the list of URL's that you want to strip. Export will be to 'c:\downloads\' as well unless you change the import and export paths within the script.
